data: |
  Data can mean any piece of information that some person or people want to use
  to answer questions. What is considered data (and metadata) is highly dependent
  on people and what they intend to do with information that is collected.

  data collected from people participating in a study on health and disease.
data package: |
  A "container" for data that describes a coherent collection of data. It consists
  of two parts: data resources and properties.
data resource: |
  A single piece of data and metadata that is part of a data package. It contains
  the actual data that is collected saved and documented following the Data Package
  standard. It consists of the raw data, the data saved in parquet format, as well
  as its properties.
properties: |
  Metadata that describes the data package as a whole as well as the data resources
  it contains. On a package level, the properties describes e.g., the name and
  description of the package, its contributors, licenses, etc. On the resource level,
  they describe the name, description, schema, fields, etc. of the data resource.
  A package's properties are saved in `datapackage.json` in the package's root
  directory.
