The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was
difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. It had
seemed they'd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody
had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, but while
they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the
shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in
another.


Here's a table:

| Name | Age |

| John | 23  |
| Jane | 24  |

A list:

1. first
2. second
3. third
